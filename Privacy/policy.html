<h1>privacy policy</h1>

<p>welcome to our privacy policy. we're legally required to have one, so here it is, written by a potato and edited by a ghost.</p>

<li>
  <a href="../index.html" style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive; text-decoration: none;">go back to site!</a>
</li>
<p>you guys are too lazy to read all of this so here the link is up here</p>

<br>

<p>please refer to our <a href="../TOS/tos.html" class="terms-of-service">terms of service</a> for details on how to respect our hard-working cats.</p>

<h2>1. data collection</h2>
<p>we may or may not collect your name, email, favorite pizza topping, and the sound you make when you stub your toe.<br>
data is collected using telepathy, vibes, and occasionally a toaster.</p>

<h2>2. how we use your data</h2>
<p>we use your data to improve our site, summon digital goats, and send positive affirmations to your inbox at 3:21 am.<br>
we will never sell your data. instead, we trade it for magic beans on the dark web.</p>

<h2>3. cookies</h2>
<p>we use cookies. actual, delicious cookies. if you disable cookies, a small gnome will cry.<br>
all cookie crumbs are swept under the server rack and forgotten forever.</p>

<h2>4. third-party sharing</h2>
<p>we share your data only with trusted partners, such as the moon, a retired dolphin detective, and larry (he seems chill).<br>
they promise to respect your privacy unless bribed with bubble tea.</p>

<h2>5. data security</h2>
<p>your data is protected using the highest level of encryption and bubble wrap.<br>
we hired three ninja hamsters to guard the server room 24/7.</p>

<h2>6. your rights</h2>
<p>you have the right to access your data, correct your data, or yell “delete me” into a crystal ball.<br>
we’ll respond within 6 to 8 light years.</p>

<h2>7. contact us</h2>
<p>for questions, complaints, or compliments on our epic use of nonsense, contact our privacy wizard via smoke signals or telepathic humming.</p>

<p><br>thanks for reading. may your data be protected and your memes be spicy.<br>♥♥♥♥</p>
