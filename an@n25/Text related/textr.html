	<h3>eye colors</h3>
	<p>red - were very close to their families or friends (examples: willow to william, penny to her family, etc.)<br>
red iris - the same as the orange iris, but it's since penny was infected for so long the eye color got distorted even after joining dude man<br>
orange - not under direct control by tio but still associated with him - as they can't teleport like the others<br>
orange iris - directly controlled and joined the insolence (or cool eye gang) - as they can teleport<br>
yellow - confirmed by minitoon, helped in their community<br>
green - were independent or alone for a period (kona researching with only robby, badgy researching for the cure possibly alone)<br>
blue - were loyal (example: foxy went into the cage for t.s.p., poley was devoted to his job and also good friends to Player and Doggy)<br>
purple - were caring - mousy does kind of ruin this theory but the other 2 are caring.<br>
white - were very protective of their friends, families etc.<br>
triple/double white - the same as white, but the infection worked different on them.<br>

	<h3>top 10 least favourite maps</h3>
	<p>10. Gallery - really tight map + father (the bot) is a pain trying to not die to.<br>
9. Plant - the green section of the map is annoying, the second phase is confusing,
both bots can corner you, and Mr. P's AI is annoying.<br>
8. Refinery - annoying to lose the bots, and is a large tight map.<br>
7. Safe Place - the map itself isn't bad, but it's very tall (the tallest i think), 
and Raze could corner you if you aren't careful.<br>
6. City - as I said, the map itself isn't that bad, but having both Elly and grandmother chasing 
you is hard at times.<br>
5. Lab & Camp - grouping these together since they have the same problems, mechanics are
very confusing at first, but over time it gets somewhat easier.<br>
4. Hospital - WAY too tight, and Beary can camp the stairs.<br>
3. Distraction & Distorted Memory - remixes of other maps, which makes them really annoying
to remember the layout, and the bots can corner you (in Distr. both the sentinels and the twins).<br>
2. Breakout - Ombra is weird, but it atleast follows a patterns, and the puzzles are weird, but
gets easier over time.<br>
1. Mansion - Duocara is confusing, also fast, the map upstairs is tight, underground is eally dark
before lighting it up, Duocara doesn't follow a pattern (the face changes whenever it wants to),
the coloring thing is weird, Duocara is too fast, and did i mention Duocara is too fast?<br></p>
